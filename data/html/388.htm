<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[LBJ writes at top of page: This
paper made of Texas cotton –]<br /><br />[Written on Congress of the United
States, House of Representatives, R. M. Kleberg stationery]<br /><br />
[September 23, 1934]<br />Sunday 10:30 a.m.<br /><br />Dear Bird;<br /><br />A
letter from you yesterday and another today is all most almost too much for me.
The thing I want more every day than anything else is a letter from you. I have
asked you to write me daily so often that what pride and self-respect I have
been able to retain since meeting you occasionly asserts itself, and,
consequently, my requests, expectations, and letters to you necessarily have
been fewer here of late. It is always such a trial for me to write a personal
letter. It has been years since I’ve written any appreciable number but
strangely enough I have a desire to talk to you sometime each day and the only
medium I have is via the letter route. Unless you give vent to your desires, if
you have such desires, and write more often, I shall naturally try to be equally
as self-composed and watch for a letter to answer later in the week.<br /><br />
I always derive such a satisfaction out of reading the generous expressions of
your father, Mrs. Boehringer, Doris, the <br /><br />2<br /><br />cook, and all
of those who have your interest at heart. It was good of them to say nice things
about me. It would be so gratifying to have some reassurances of yours to blend
with those considerate utterances. I could read and reread a letter from you
which contained just one central idea, tho’ that idea concerned itself only with
expressions of your love. I want to hear you say over and over again that “I
love you”. You may remember that one time you told me “Someday I may feel that
way and when I do--I shall very likely tell you of my own volition.” That should
have been enough--ordinarily it would have been too much--but even the strongest
of men sometime don’t follow their judgment but submit to a dictate from
elsewhere. Tell me soon, dear, just how you know you do feel--if feel you do.<br
/><br />This week I’ve been a very busy little man. In the office until five--in
school from five until seven--in my room studying from seven thirty until after
twelve but thinking of you some all during that time. I take Criminal Law and
Procedure, Contracts, Torts and Personal Property. Am very much impressed with
the thorough <br /><br />3<br /><br />type of instruction and the scholarly
lecturers. Not a girl in the class of almost two hundred and every student
straining to get each word. The course is a most difficult one. I hope I can
continue to keep up my assignments and make the grade. I don’t expect to retain
all of the duties that have been mine for the past years, however, and do
justice to both.<br /><br />For days we have been looking at apartments. This
morning I almost decided to continue on at the Dodge. All is so uncertain that
it is with a great deal of hesitancy that I think of taking a lease on an
apartment.<br /><br />After the first semester I may be in New York. Maybe in
Austin and if you weren’t always popping up in my mind I might conclude to quit
this game and peacefully go with the University of Houston. Thursday, Mr. Adams,
the National Public Relations man for General Electric, called me and asked me
to <br /><br />4<br /><br />drop by his office at the Shoreham building for a
further talk during the week. He wanted me to go in Mr. Youngs office in N.Y.
last year but Mr. Miller thought we had better wait a year.<br /> Late
yesterday, R. H. Kelly of Andrews, Kelly, Kurth and Campbell in Houston came by
and talked for an hour in the office. Then we left after five and visited the
St. Franciscan Monastery. One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been and I
wished for you every minute. From the monastery we went to the Mayflower for
dinner. We ate entirely too much and decided to walk. We walked thro’ the parks,
down in front of the White House, and back to the Hotel. He told me of important
people--important cases and lots of things that should have been important to
me--but all of the time I could only see the moon and do my best to attempt to
follow his discourse. I wanted so much to walk with you last night. Your letter
this morning was the next best thing to it.<br /><br />5<br /><br />Upon
reflection it occurred to me that you must have at sometime met Mr. Kelly. He is
frequently here practicing before the Interstate Commerce Commission but his
firm represents the Mo. Pacific in Texas. He is in Austin quite frequently. A
student and a scholar, he always gives me such an inspiration.<br /><br />
Yesterday I wrote Gene and Dotty. I insisted to Gene that the two of you hurry
to Washington tho’ I confidently expect neither of you to come. Of course I hope
and pray that I am wrong.<br /><br />I’m afraid, darling, you didn’t quite
understand what I meant when I said to you that I had entertained thoughts of
coming to Texas Thanksgiving. My only reason for wanting to come to Texas at all
is you and I only want to come for you. It isn’t at all difficult for me <br />
<br />6<br /><br />to understand why you shouldn’t be interested in such a
proffer. My own egotism, to which you have occasionly alluded, would permit my
appreciating your acquiescence. Tho’ distracting and disturbing I am not
confronted with either of the above but rather with a dilemma – the like of
which I have never faced. On and on into June--then, well, maybe--perhaps--it
depends etc….never sure, never contented--always doubtful. Such uncertainties
have never contributed to my pleasures.<br /><br />Again I repeat--I love
you--only you. Want to always love--only you. It is an important decision. It
isn’t being made in one night--it probably never will be yours--but your lack of
decision hasn’t tempered either my affection, devotion or ability to know what I
want. I don’t want to go on this way. Do you? Will you tell me? Give me lots of
letters next week. I’m going to need them. Mix some “I love you” in the lines
and not between them. <br /><br /> Adios until tomorrow. Lyndon<br /><br />

House, Dorothy Territo, a staff assistant who maintained files of high
historical value, as well as family and genealogical material, had custody of
the collection. In 1969, the files she kept came to Austin as part of President
Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded to the U.S. government in August 1965.This
collection includes the courtship letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia
"Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period between their introduction and their
marriage, September – November 1934.<!-- ?php echo
