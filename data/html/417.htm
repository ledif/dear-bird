<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on House of
Representatives stationery]<br /><br />[October 24, 1934]<br />Wednesday<br />
<br />My dearest Bird;<br /><br />A long, precious letter late yesterday written
Friday and your Special written Sunday this morning present some more
incontrovertible evidence that you are the greatest girl in the world.<br /><br
/>I was so happy all day yesterday--and what a perfect ending this morning about
one when I turned in to get some sleep. My letter penned yesterday will tell you
about everything up until late in the day. When I returned from school and
dinner I went to my room to begin studying and found a large <br /><br />2<br />
<br />package on my bed that had been left there by a special delivery messenger
from the Senate. For a minute I thought it must not have been intended for me
but then I saw a little card in the corner with my name on the small envelope.
On the card inside was written--“May this serve to remind you of our
appreciation of your friendship. Mr. Arthur C. Perry &amp; Mr. Robert M.
Jackson.” The package contained a large--beautiful--all leather brief case with
my name on it. It is one of the best, and just the thing I need every day. Bob
&amp; Perry are Texas boys I’ve known since I came here. Perry was formerly Sen.
Connally’s secretary and is now an attorney for the Fed. Communications
Commission. Bob received an appointment as secretary <br /><br />3<br /><br />to
Senator Connally only Sunday. He is now assistant Senate Librarian and hails
from San Angelo where he worked as Editor of the Standard Times. He knows a boy
on the paper in Marshall and insists that I take him to Texas Xmas.<br /><br />
Hardly had I finished giving the brief case the once over when Helen called to
tell me she had tickets to the play at the National. We will go Fri or Sat.
night. The play ‘Bring on the Girls’ is by Kaufman and Ryskind who wrote “Of
Thee I Sing” which I so thoroughly enjoyed last year. Some say ‘Bring on the
Girls’ will be temporarily withdrawn from circulation after Saturday night and
rewritten <br /><br />4<br /><br />from the end of the first act on. Helen tells
me that it is an overstretched farce aimed at the more vulnerable aspects of the
present operation of the New Deal. The producers sent the Secretary of Ag. &amp;
several others in the dept. comps. in order to indicate the lines weren’t
personal etc. The New Dealers that have seen it say it out farces farce and is
about the equivalent of reading a copy of Life as opposed to a Dickens novel. In
short, as it is now, it must be nothing more than a few gorgeous gags. But it
will be fun, and after a week in school, it will be helpful.<br /><br />Honey, I
think you need <br /><br />5<br /><br />have little concern about my worries
now. Mr. Dick is with the madam in Monterrey this week. Mr. Miller sent me a
very generous letter this morning which read in part “I am most grateful for
your two telegrams, one which was received Saturday and the personal one which
came this morning (Sunday). Old fellow, you have certainly done everything
possible. I hope to have a further conference etc…and want to again thank you
for your kindness in this and other matters in which I impose on you.” Then
Maury called (person to person) yesterday. After talking to him for several
minutes Malcolm said Hello. Then Dan sent me an Airmail Special this morning<br
/><br />6<br /><br />and all in all I’m very contented just now.<br /><br />I
know your Dad is pleased over the pictures of your brothers. Does he expect to
get one to go along beside them as a result of your Dallas trip? Lyndon is
patiently and anxiously waiting.<br /><br />It was so thoughtful of you to send
your Sunday letter Airmail &amp; Special. You do want to make me very
happy--don’t you darling?<br /><br />Bill White has just called and we’ve
planned a trip down the Skyline drive Sunday. The girls will make sandwiches and 
<br /><br />[7]<br /><br />we will spend the day in the country returning late
Sunday refreshed with new energy and enthusiasm. I don’t think I could want you
more than I have today.<br /><br />No letter from Gene in several days. It
couldn’t be the ball game--could it? Dotty hasn’t written. Guess I must be
neglected for a while at that end.<br /><br />Have been intending to tell you
everyday about a little orange comb I carry in <br /><br />[8]<br /><br />my
billfold. It is the only thing I have from my little girl at Karnack and when I
get lonesome and blue or happy and ambitious I always get pleasure when I look
at the little comb and think…just think.<br /><br />I feel that you are very
happy now. Things have worked out just as you would have them and I’m sure it is
the better for all of us.<br /><br />Here is all my affection. I love you
much--too much. No!<br /><br />Lyndon<br /><br />[Envelope postmarked:
Washington, D.C., 10/28/1934, 10:30 AM]<br /><br />[Transcript prepared by LBJ
