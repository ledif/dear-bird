<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on Congress of the United
States, House of Representatives, R. M. Kleberg stationery]<br /><br />Friday
Noon<br />October 26, 1934<br /><br />Darling;<br /><br />Your Special Airmail
written Monday came Wednesday. It thrilled me. Made me blue-- and made me
realize all the more what a good and great character you are. I don’t have your
letter at the office so I can’t answer all of the many questions you propounded.
I’ll touch on some of them now and possibly tell you about the others when and
if I see you later in the year.<br /><br />About our continuing to write--the
answer to that can best be found in our individual reactions to our own impulses
coupled with some consideration for our innermost feelings.<br /><br />
Circumstances and conditions cannot and will not temper the love I have for you.
Never do I want to care quite so much for anyone. I’m sure I never could. Days
before I knew <br /><br />2<br /><br />what tomorrow would bring I told my best
friend about you. My plans, my hopes and my love. Yesterday Mother answered and
since her views so clearly coincide with those you share I know they will be of
interest. “I am very much interested in all you have to say about Bird. I
thought from the fleeting glimpse I had of her that she is a lovely girl with
all of the earmarks of a refined lady. Rest assured if you find Bird to be the
one and only I shall take her into my very heart of hearts. Of course I desire
your happiness above everything and all that contribute to that are prized by
me. You are so splendid and thoroughly fine, so sensitively organized and
idealistic that your choice of a wife will affect your entire life more than
such a decision ordinarily influences a man. Your ideals must be on the same
plane; your principles must be identical; your tastes should be harmonious; your
temperaments may be opposite and perfect love must exist.” Mother uses “perfect”
and you say “permanent and everlasting” but to me the word love comprehends the
ideas conception of Mother has well as the ideas you entertain and the
qualifications you apply. She writes “While of course in a way--a selfish
proprietary way--I dread the thought of some other woman having the first place
which your wife will and should have. I should be happy in knowing that <br />
<br />3<br /><br />you have the love and companionship you so richly deserve and
a home of your own. I want the best in life for the finest and truest son, the
most loyal and high minded of boys in the world. Go slow, darling, and be sure;
only be certain is all I ask. I am very, very proud of you and want you to
accomplish the great things for which you are destined. The right woman will
help you to the top. You think things over carefully; know the girl and your own
heart, and do what is best, dear.” I could hardly fail to appreciate now your
deliberateness. Care, caution, certain, perfect, everlasting and sure are
qualifications to love which are evidently common to intelligent women. To me
just love embraces all of these. You should know just how I feel about you. It
may not be wise to go into too much detail.<br /><br />Yesterday I sent you a
small picture. I later learned it needed several more stamps. Sorry. The
Bachrack people tell me your large picture is to be mailed direct. I hope you
like the frame. I would have so much preferred for you to make your own
selection.<br /><br />Lunch at the Capitol with Helen, at the departments all
afternoon and at the office until one this morning and at sometime--somewhere I
caught another terrible cold.<br /><br />4<br /><br />If it weren’t for my
school this afternoon and “Bring on the Girls” tonight I would go to bed when I
finish this letter.<br /><br />The G. E. place in N. Y. went out of the picture
Saturday morning after my talk with Welly and the Senator. Mr. Adams doubted the
advisability of my returning to Texas but expressed a great deal of confidence
in Welly’s judgment. Adams left for Texas Saturday night and plans to stay there
until Congress convenes in January. He has suggested that Welly meet him in So.
Texas next month and Welly has accepted the invitation.<br /><br />Gene writes
of Mrs. Marshall’s death. I am very fond of Mr. Marshall. He has been very good
to me. Later in her letter Gene says:--“Our trip in January may not materialize
now. I should like to be there November 12 – 15 for the convention of N. A. of
Railroad Commissioners. I’m afraid we won’t have a representative there, as the
API meets in Dallas those dates and the Congressional Committee will be there
also.” Would I be presuming <br /><br />5<br /><br />too suggest--even
insist--that you two choose the Washington convention in preference to the API?
Don’t be too deliberate, honey. Call Gene--get your tickets and hurry up here.
We will take two or three days out of the office and visit Maryland, Va--perhaps
New York in my little Ford. Will you?<br /><br />I love you--<br /><br />Lyndon

in the White House, Dorothy Territo, a staff assistant who maintained files of
high historical value, as well as family and genealogical material, had custody
of the collection. In 1969, the files she kept came to Austin as part of
President Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded to the U.S. government in August
1965.This collection includes the courtship letters between Lyndon Johnson and
Claudia "Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period between their introduction and their
marriage, September – November 1934.<!-- ?php echo
