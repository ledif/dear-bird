<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on BIRD TAYLOR stationery]
<br /><br />[October 19, 1934 ?]<br /><br />Friday<br /><br />My own dearest –
<br /><br />Your Sunday morning letter came today. And I’m only now beginning to
worry about how sick you were, bless your heart! I do wish I’d been there to
tend to you.<br /><br />Dear, you said “when, and if, I come to Texas we must
all get together in Austin and see how congenial we could all be.” Did you
happen to know that whenever you come to Texas I am going to be with you all the
time you can put <br /><br />2<br /><br />up with me?--I mean all the time that
I wouldn’t be in the way--or an imposition--because I won’t ever have anything
more important. When you have to be in Austin or vicinity I could visit Gene,
and we could be together here (I’d show you how smart I’ve been, doing things
and cooking things!)<br /><br />I like this letter better than the one I had
yesterday--which, alas, was more recent. But this one also left me wondering.<br
/><br />So you won’t write me so often, young man? Well, I shall write you just
as often and perhaps I shall get you back into the <br /><br />3<br /><br />
habit. I shall try. I could scarcely do without writing you, somehow.<br /><br
/>Gene did deliver the message--very sweetly!<br /><br />I am so sorry about
your Gene (the other is our Gene). Give him my best regards. He looks like a
cherub, doesn’t he? I do hope he’s quite well now.<br /><br />Darling, I’ll send
back the ranch pictures and clippings sometimes. I want to keep one of the
pictures of the Kleberg house if--do you mind?..I also want one or two of the
other things--may I?<br /><br />I want the letter you are going to resurrect and
revise. Will it tell me about your New York offer and whatever was troubling you
in South Texas?? You havn’t yet you know. And I am so interested.<br /><br />4
<br /><br />I’m not out of the confidence, am I, dear? Have you reached any
decision or is everything still pending?<br /><br />Listen, Lyndon, there’s one
thing that mustn’t go on--You said “For weeks I’ve only half heartedly done
anything” Stop it, dear! (That’s a command!) One of the things I like most about
you is that you’re always on the que vive and full of enthusiasm about your
work. Please, darling, don’t let anything stop that! You won’t, will you?<br />
<br />I’ve been reading Lincoln Steffens and adore him. He is such a darling
little boy--he hasn’t grown up yet--I’m on page 50.<br /><br />The article about
Maury was <br /><br />[5]<br /><br />real romance! I did enjoy it. I hope
sometimes I shall know him. I’m ever so glad when I see one of those envelopes
with “House of Reps - Public Document” in the corner!<br /><br />Here I go
writing another folder and I hadn’t meant to. Am I not writing you long letters
these days? (That’s because you seem not to know how much I love you, and also
because I shall not let you forget me!)<br /><br />Today I had quite delightful
mail--one especially from Gene that I read avidly. Which reminds me, dear, of
what you said about <br /><br />6<br /><br />Gene’s view of life and your coming
to see that it might have something to it--the friends versus lovers idea, you
know. I think very highly of the idea myself--friends are more comfortable, more
likely to be lasting, and oh so very gratifying! But for a life arrangement that
would never do for me. Its fine for just now--for some indeterminate time--a few
months, a year--but that isn’t the basis I shall plan my life on.<br /><br />You
remember those little pictures of my infant brothers, Tommy and Tony? I found
frames for them and today hung them in Daddy’s room; and I’ve shellaced <br />
<br /> 7<br /><br />two large cane chairs, and made a salad, and fixed three
lovely bouquets, and written one letter! And that’s today…it almost amuses me
how I enjoy them when I’m used to much more vivid and entertaining life…One
reason I enjoy them is because I’ve the mail to look forward to and you to think
about.<br /><br />Isn’t it funny, Lyndon, how much we figure in each other’s
thoughts (or do we?--you do anyway) when a mere two months ago we didn’t know or
care anything about each other…I often wonder whom I thought about-- or quite
how everything was before <br /><br />8<br /><br />I knew you…I can’t remember.
There wasn’t any void. I was quite happy. But now if you were removed--there
wouldn’t be anything, it seems!<br /><br />And now I shall look forward to
tomoro--, if there is only a dear, sweet letter from you everything will be
fine!..I love you so much. I never want to bring you anything but happiness.
Please don’t ever be unhappy about me Lyndon, not for one minute. In the next
few months or one year we shall find the way out of our difficulties. And during
that time I shall not let you forget me. (I sound awfully brave, but you won’t
will you dear?) And all the time I want only to make you happier for knowing me
and having me in your life. My love--Bird<br /><br />[Transcript prepared by LBJ

comes to Texas she will be with him &quot;all the time you can put up

She comments on his low spirits and encourages him to have enthusiasm for his
work. She writes about the day&#039;s activities, and ends saying &quot;we shall
find the way out of our difficulties.&quot;</div><h3>Rights</h3><div class="

Personal Papers of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson are a collection of
correspondence between Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson that spans 1934 through
1968. During the Johnsons’ years in the White House, Dorothy Territo, a staff
assistant who maintained files of high historical value, as well as family and
genealogical material, had custody of the collection. In 1969, the files she
kept came to Austin as part of President Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded
to the U.S. government in August 1965.This collection includes the courtship
letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia "Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period
between their introduction and their marriage, September – November 1934.<!--
