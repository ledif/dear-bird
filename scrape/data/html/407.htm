<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on House of
Representatives, Committee on Agriculture stationery]<br /><br />[October 14,
1934]<br />Sunday 11:20 a.m.<br /><br />My dearest:<br /><br />After talking to
you only a few hours ago it seems “silly” to write and repeat what I told you,
or attempt to sidetrack my thoughts, and talk about something else.<br /><br />
Yesterday afternoon after suffering in bed for hours I insisted it would be
great to talk with my Bird. Only an hour before I placed the call I had, flat of
my back with cover all over me, written a wire to you. Then Maury and Dan left
on the 6:30 train for Texas. Friday night I wrote you a long 7 page letter only
to decide that it shouldn’t be mailed--and now I know it shouldn’t have. At 8 I
was to pick up Whit Thairon &amp; wife and join some friends for a long evening.
I knew if I talked to you that I would either be so disappointed that I would
need them to help me forget or so happy I couldn’t celebrate without them. It
turned out just that way. I placed the call while in bed at the hotel--knowing 
<br /><br />2<br /><br />I shouldn’t get out in the night air. In a minute Mrs.
Crow said you were at the ball game and would come home in an hour. Then I
called Helen who had been at the Navy game all afternoon and secured her consent
to join us and in addition an invite for a meal before going. On my way out to
her apartment I stopped by the office for an overcoat and tried on my call
again--in only a minute I was talking to you. Then disappointed, I dropped in at
Helens 30 min late and got quarreled at for being tardy. At 9 our party was
going strong and Bill was fussing because I told him you had said that Texas
lost 31– 0. I told him better an hour later--but by that time I was too
miserable to enjoy it with him. At 12 we came home and I doctored most all of
the night. This morning I went to the desk just before coming to the office and
got your <br /><br />3<br /><br />special. You timed it just right this time.
When I finish this note I’m going to my room and stay there until--I feel much
better tho’ it may require a week behind the bars.<br /><br />Yes, honey, I was
disappointed in your not saying yes enthusiastically. We approach things so
differently tho’ I’m confident your judgment was the best. I shan’t tell you
what prompted my eagerness or attempt to offer an explanation. It must have been
just [illegible word crossed out] you.<br /><br />All my life I’ve worked for
people. I’ve tried to do my bit to make life enjoyable for my family and my
friends. About the time I met you it looked as if my task was about complete. My
brother and sisters educated and most of my friends doing well and where they
wanted to be. Then you came along with all of the things I have been taught to
treasure and hold sacred. I jumped <br /><br />4<br /><br />too quickly. It was
such a relief--it was so satisfying to have something of my own--I’ll quit
there--This morning I’ve just been writing without taking time for even a comma.
If I hesitated a bit I wouldn’t say what I’m thinking.<br /><br />Now I’m going
back to live and play just for each day. It was foolish anyway to have “the
desire of the moth for the star.”<br /><br />I know you must have had a great
time in Dallas. Would that I could have been there to meet your friends and with
you to have added them to that group of which I am so proud. When, and if, I
come to Texas we must all get together in Austin and see how congenial we could
all be.<br /><br />Gene gave me a very sweet letter yesterday. It is only now
that I realize that there can be something to her view of life. She told me in 
<br /><br />5<br /><br />Austin how great it was to love--“friends”.<br /><br />
Tomorrow I’ll write Dotty. Gene had told me of her terrible experience.<br /><br
/>Under separate cover I’m mailing an article about Maury which you might enjoy
reading.<br /><br />Perhaps I act too hositly hastily. People sometimes tell me
“you are too sentimental and tempermental” but anyway I’ve the best and greatest
friends in all the world.<br /><br />I won’t write as often or as “silly” but
that won’t keep me from saying to myself “in absolute honesty that I love you”
and that means “everlastingly” and “permanently.”<br /><br />Hope you were able
to talk to Welly. Trust that Gene delivered my message and my …. Thanks for the
thoughtful rose leaf.<br /><br />My little Gene has been in bed <br /><br />6<br
/><br />with my flu and I’m more than concerned about him. May get the doctor
after lunch.<br /><br />I’m so glad your Dad enjoyed the ranch pictures. Return
them with my proofs if this reaches you before the proofs are mailed.<br /><br
/>I know you have had a time reading this writing. I can do much better, but
usually Sundays make me so different and I write more freely and less
cautiously.<br /><br />A day or two ago I wrote you a long letter--told you all
about everything--but didn’t exercise good judgment in the last paragraph--(just
as I didn’t last night) hence it is some unmailed and somewhere in my room. I’ll
resurrect it--revise it if I can--and as general information about Tex, N.Y,
Austin and here, forward it on to you. I know you are having a great time
watching your efforts build. You seem to enjoy <br /><br />7<br /><br />
everything you do so much that I think it would be well for me to try to develop
some inspiration and stimulation. For weeks I’ve only half-heartedly done
everything.<br /><br />I’ve written too much--haven’t I? I hope what I’ve said
is best for both of us---and let’s make it that way. I have looked for a letter
Welly wrote me one ‘Xmas on friendship. Did I send it to you? It was such a
masterpiece that I want to always keep it. Honey now that you have gone over the
newspaper clippings and junk I sent you put them in an old shoe box of some kind
and get them out of your way by sending them to me. I’m going to have Carol take
them and paste them in a little scrapbook.<br /><br />The library books don’t
have to be returned at any particular time. Will send you some more if you have
time to read them<br /><br />So glad Gene got to go to Dallas and had a chance
to see Marie, you, and her mother.<br /><br />Affectionately--<br /><br />
Lyndon.<br /><br />[Envelope postmarked: Washington, D.C., 10/16/1934, 6:30 PM]

not to mail it. He describes going out with friends despite still being sick and
says Gene [Latimer] now has his flu. LBJ comments on Lady Bird&#039;s trip to
Dallas, wishing he had been there. He asks her to return the clippings, proofs,
and ranch pictures he sent. He says he will not write as often or as
&quot;silly&quot; but will continue to love her.</div><h3>Rights</h3><div class

Personal Papers of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson are a collection of
correspondence between Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson that spans 1934 through
1968. During the Johnsons’ years in the White House, Dorothy Territo, a staff
assistant who maintained files of high historical value, as well as family and
genealogical material, had custody of the collection. In 1969, the files she
kept came to Austin as part of President Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded
to the U.S. government in August 1965.This collection includes the courtship
letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia "Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period
between their introduction and their marriage, September – November 1934.<!--
