<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[October 16, 1934 pm ?]<br /><br />
Tuesday Nite<br /><br />Lyndon, dearest –<br /><br />Tonight I feel quite
low--which angers me--I can’t bear any signs of weakness and I love being on the
up-and-up. Its because I’ve just come back from the gay, convivial life to this
semi-solitude. If I’d arrived in the early morning and had a day’s work to do I
would feel quite satisfied!--(I quite know myself, Lyndon!)<br /><br />Anyway,
tomoro I shall have enough things to do--going to Shreveport to see Somdal about
finishing up <br /><br />2<br /><br />the plans, to Marshall to see Cockrell
about the lay-out of the lawn, directing my colored boy about the trees he’s to
finish trimming, and home in time to cook something good for supper!<br /><br />
If I hadn’t heard from you Saturday in Dallas I should be worried about you.
Your last letter was written Thursday when you were in bed with the flu. Poor
lamb! And Thursday was a long time ago. <br /><br />Lyndon dearest, here’s
something that will probably interest you. Do you remember I told you about
Victor McCrea, <br /><br />3<br /><br />who has been a very dear friend of mine
for about a year and whom I visited in Washington? He has left there and is with
Raymond Buck, attorney, in Ft. Worth now. So of course he came over to see me,
Sunday afternoon. We rode around a bit and then had some Tom Collins at the
Shamrock and dinner in the White Room of the Adolphus.…While we were in the
Shamrock I told Vic that, as far as my simple mind can see at <br /><br />4<br
/><br />present, I am in love with one Lyndon Johnson and that I may be married
within the next year. (I really should have waited until after dinner--it was a
most excellent dinner and we couldn’t swallow a bite, but when I’ve something
important to say I usually blurt it out).<br /><br />Everything turned out fine
in the end after a good deal of talking, and I’m so glad I told him because I
don’t think it would have been quite on the up-and-up for either of us three not
to have, would <br /><br />5 <br /><br />it dear? And Vic said there’s bound to
be some good in everything because now I’ll quit fussing at him about when he
drinks more than three!<br /><br />So now I’m very relieved! Vic and I are still
the best of friends and but he understands how the situation is and nobody is
hurt and everybody is more-or-less happy!<br /><br />The New Dealers came
today--or rather it was here waiting for me--and I’m so glad. (Its most vital
virile and fresh--I’ve already read a bit in it<br /><br /> 6<br /><br />Thank
you my dearest. The football game was quite fun. I saw people I hadn’t seen
since last year in school and had more fun laying eyes on the compadres of
yesteryear! In the third quarter it began to rain and we scrammed out and just
as we got to the Poultry Building it began so hard that we had to run it in and
sought take refuge with the chickens for an hour or so…That night everybody was
drunk in all Dallas, nearly. I had a date with Gordon and F. D., <br /><br /> 7
<br /><br />two good friends of mine and Gene’s who are all of eighteen a piece
but who are very well-informed and intelligent and giddy and terrifically
entertaining. We had dinner at the Baker and talked about life with a capital L,
and books, and New York.<br /><br />But here I am back at the ménage with more
rivers to cross and jobs to tackle and enthusiasm at low ebb! (It will be back
tomoro--I shall fetch it--and so will energy and determination).<br /><br />8<br
/><br />But, heavens, how this letter rattles on ad infinitum ad nauseum and so
incoherently too!<br /><br />Emily, Helen, and all the Crow family (I am their
adopted daughter) are wild to meet you! They are all very interested in what
becomes of us.<br /><br />Listen, my lamb, you haven’t told me one more word
about GE and South Texas! Please, may I hear? About your question, dear--if you
remember: I’m afraid not Thanksgiving--its so terribly close! Please don’t mind,
will you not? Mayn’t I have until January to decide? I love you, Lyndon, Bird. I
do hope you’re well now.<br /><br />[Transcript prepared by LBJ Library staff,
January 2013]</div>

Personal Papers of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson are a collection of
correspondence between Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson that spans 1934 through
1968. During the Johnsons’ years in the White House, Dorothy Territo, a staff
assistant who maintained files of high historical value, as well as family and
genealogical material, had custody of the collection. In 1969, the files she
kept came to Austin as part of President Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded
to the U.S. government in August 1965.This collection includes the courtship
letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia "Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period
between their introduction and their marriage, September – November 1934.<!--
