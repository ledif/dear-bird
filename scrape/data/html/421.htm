<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on Congress of the United
States, House of Representatives, R. M. Kleberg stationery]<br /><br />Thursday
Night – 9 PM<br />[November 8, 1934 ?]<br /><br />Darling--<br /><br />My
letters are always so involved that it is with some reluctance that I begin an
attempt to discuss with you via the letter route the subject that occupied most
of our conversation this evening.<br /><br />Altho’ I was thrilled to death when
the operator told me in the lobby that you were calling I couldn’t help but feel
let down after you had repeated your doubts.<br /><br />I shall expect you to
call me from Ala.--or when you enter Texas, and I’ll be most anxious to get some
reassurance. If after your trip you want to, or can wait until after
Thanksgiving, then I’ll completely understand. Now about the telephone
conversation--<br /> It seemed sweet but non-commital.<br /><br />2<br /><br />
To me it has always seemed a safe rule to take my cue as to my behavoir from the
other persons attitude, so since you seem calm and cool and want plenty of time
to “make up your mind” I think why not simulate indifference myself. I’m sure in
some instances indifference may add charm. It might be best to abide by your
decision with apparent calm acquiescence and just see what would happen. If you
don’t know your own mind, I won’t press you, in spite of my ardent nature, and
more than that I want it all to end as quickly as possible. Of course I’m hurt
that you are undemonstrative and analytical in regard to your emotions. I’m
afraid, dear, your instinctive reticence does not hold an appeal for my
peculiarities of temperament. I had hoped I was and wanted<br /><br />3<br /><br
/>to marry a woman who loved me, would pet me, and be as affectionate as I am.
<br /><br />If you want me and are just holding off--then don’t wait.<br /><br
/>If you, after comparing the relative merits of various suitors, think you
might be happy then tell me.<br /><br />My decision is the same in either case.
You should know how I feel about you. I shall not attempt to cover up what I’ve
said or done the last 2 days. I’ll wait until you find time to write or call
until before I make further plans.<br /><br />If your Aunt Effie or Gene or any
of the other people you love prompt you to want to wait--wire--write or phone
and I’ll call it a bad day and return immediately <br /><br />4<br /><br />to my
labours elsewhere away from Corpus. I’ll not be grieved or hurt at you--rather
wonder that you can feel as you do.<br /><br />Mother too (wonders) about it
all. I think I’m the only person that is positive and it may be it will be best
for you to wait until another comes along.<br /><br />I love you. Thanks for the
telephone call.<br /><br />Lyndon<br /><br />P. S. Have a letter from Gene and
am afraid to answer it. Guess I’ll try.<br /><br />Think you might enjoy Mothers
letter. It may be what you want to hear. I’ll tell you what all of my business
friends think after you know again definitely.<br /><br /> [The following letter
from LBJ’s mother is enclosed.]<br /><br />Tues. [November 6, 1934 ?]<br /><br
/>My darling Boy:<br /><br />You have been in my thoughts almost constantly ever
since you were here. I am wondering what decision you will make. Personally I
should prefer to have you near me of course but when I consider what is best for
you I disregard the personal element. I had to do that when you first went to
Washington; that was the first and hardest wrench. The knife turned in the wound
when you had pneumonia way off up there. I want you so much, darling , but I
want your happiness and success more than the gratification of my feelings.<br
/><br />The thing for you to do is to get your law degree, I am sure. If you can
do that and work for<br /><br />[2]<br /><br />Mr. Kleberg I think that would be
best. It seems to me that some arrangement could be effected in which another
stenographer could be employed in the place of L. E. or Gene who could be
transferred somewhere else. This man could take charge of the office while you
were in school.<br /><br />The Austin plan sounds good to me for some reasons
and if it does not mean severing your connection with Mr. K -- it is splendid. I
think he is one of Nature’s noblemen and I am very proud for you to be
associated with a man of his high standards, clean living, and genuine
culture--a real thoroughbred. He<br /><br />[3]<br /><br />has character and not
many, dear, do. The best thing for you to do is to sit down and talk it all out
with him. He is a real friend and his kind of friendship counts.<br /><br />Ben
was here this morning and had lots to say about you. He says everyone considers
you Congressional timber. You have made a man of him.<br /><br />We surely
enjoyed your visit Sunday and of course the girls too. I had never met Jean
before and understand now why all of you do. I hardly know what to say about
Bird except that you have been exaggerating your feeling for her I believe. You
do not act like a man so in love as you have been telling me. Do you know,
honey, I think <br /><br />[4]<br /><br />you have decided it is time for you to
fall in love and you are accordingly proceeding to do so. Honey, am I teasing
you too much? But really and truly I do not believe that you are genuinely and
everlastingly in love. But understand this, my sweet son, if you decide you are
I am behind you. Whatever you do in love or business you have me backing you. I
say as you request me to, what I think and then whatever you decide I am with
you heart &amp; soul.<br /><br />Lucia went home this afternoon. Surely will
miss her. She was greatly excited over the prospect of your getting her the work
you mention. Took off the proof you gave me of you. She thinks you are the
greatest brother in the world.<br /><br />Not much news. Hope you come up soon
again. Am so glad you are near me. You looked so splendid and handsome Sun. I am
so proud of my son. Write me.<br /><br />Dearest Love – Mamma<br /><br />

well as family and genealogical material, had custody of the collection. In
1969, the files she kept came to Austin as part of President Johnson’s papers,
which he had deeded to the U.S. government in August 1965.This collection
includes the courtship letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia "Lady Bird"
Taylor, from the period between their introduction and their marriage, September
