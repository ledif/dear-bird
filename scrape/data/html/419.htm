<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on Congress of the United
States, House of Representatives, R. M. Kleberg stationery]<br /><br />[October
27, 1934]<br />Saturday Noon<br /><br />My dear--<br /><br />This morning in the
early mail the postman brought me your letter written Wednesday night. It made
me very happy, but the gem was written Tuesday night. I stopped by the hotel on
my way to school and it was waiting for me. I read it several times before I
finally retired at two this morning. <br /><br />Upon reflection I thought it
best not to send you the long letter I referred to which outlined the problems
which were giving me concerns. It had entirely too much in it about an
unpleasant subject--at least unpleasant in 1934. Then, too, later developments
would make all I said sound very silly. I am about ready to conclude that my
letters are not nearly as persuasive and appealing as they should
be--consequently it is frequently that I hesitate to write all I think or all
that I want to say. (over)<br /><br />2<br /><br />But when I think of our
unsatisfactory telephone conversations, coupled with the expense that “person to
person calls” involve, I’m reluctant to blame it all on my letters.<br /><br />
My Senators haven’t written since I talked to them and I know very little that
you would be interested in that I haven’t written told you. Welly may call
tonight. A letter from the University today tells me that my credits have been
approved and the schedule worked out for me is satisfactory to them. Evidently
some of the courses I’m taking here are not offered at Texas the second semester
but they state I can get them in the summer. I’m very, very anxious to hear
something further before the end of another week. It appears that my entrance at
Texas takes my first semester work here for granted, hence I probably won’t
leave here until late in January. If I can do the job, exist and finish as they
have planned purely from the economical aspect it will be well worth the change.
Only I want a lot of things more than surplus cash.<br /><br />About the
financial angle, dear, I’m sure the salary will be some less than I’m making
here but much more when the buying power is taken into consideration. It isn’t
enough for the two of us tho’ and the work salary following graduation won’t be.
It is bad to fall in love with a girl who has had some comforts and advantages
but it is worse than bad to attempt to make her happy with a nominal salary
after marriage. Haven’t learned that from marriage but took a few lessons from a
good teacher <br /><br />3<br /><br />when I was only a youngster. No, honey, I
haven’t over-estimated what my Bird should have.<br /><br />Now, dear, a minute
on what I’m supposed to take back--‘taken at the flood’ etc. I’m sure we care
just as much as we did a few weeks ago. What I meant to convey in that statement
to convey was not “that I was glad to have the golden opportunity gone and over
with” but to explain in some way that our different approaches to questions were
very different, thus creating a question in our minds as to the possibility of a
future for each other. That sentence is somewhat involved--this may make it
easier--I see something I know I want--I immediately exert efforts to get it. I
do or I don’t but I try and do my best. You see something you might want--you
tear it to pieces in an effort to determine if you should want it. Then you
wonder why you want it, and conclude that maybe the desire isn’t an
“everlasting” one and that it is t the “sane” thing to do is to wait a year or
so, and then if you <br /><br />4<br /><br />still want it, to decide at that
time whether or not you should make an effort to get it. It may be love--it may
be a new job, or it might be the purchase of a new car. I try to be reasonably
deliberate. I try to keep my feet on the ground. I keep from going off
half-cocked, because I realize the personal effect of all such decisions. “We
can make our own floods and tides” but it wouldn’t be best for me to decide the
way out--then wait a year or two on you to deliberate, only to find we had been
caught in the meantime.<br /><br />A letter from Mother and Josefa this morning.
Mother says: “How is the lady-love? Have you heard from her this week? I am sure
she writes clever and lovely letters; doesn’t she? How old is she? All the
details are of interest to your Mother who loves you so dearly.” And I’m very
glad she too loves you. Outside of your love I want no one to care for me, to
admire and respect me, quite as much as I do your father. He has done so much
for you that you couldn’t disappoint him at this stage of life.<br /><br />The
show last night didn’t get over with me. I was quite disgusted with it. We drove
to the <br /><br />5<br /><br />apartment about eleven and Helen talked until
almost two. At my insistence she told me all about her father. He will retire
next year from the N. Y. Court of Appeals--having reached the age limit.
Roosevelt appointed him to this the highest court in N. Y. just before he
finished his tenure as Governor. Last year I met Helen’s Mother and we spent
several interesting evenings together. The Mother has now asked Helen to have me
visit them ‘Xmas and if I’m here I’m going up to spend a day or two. One should
get such an inspiration from just a few hours around such a scholar.<br /><br />
If I followed my natural impulses tonight I would stay in my room and read until
it was time to call you--then I would have a long sweet talk with my love--read
some more--get anxious to leave immediately for Texas--then go go--go to bed.
But I’ll probably approach this question cautiously--with deliberation--think
about the extravagance [illegible word scratched out] involved--and finally at
the last minute run out to the Shoreham for a few hours dancing with an incident
expenditure <br /><br />6<br /><br />of several telephone calls--only to wake up
late in the morning to start on our Sunday picnic in Va.<br /><br />I shall be
so anxious to receive the pictures and Thanks for the cotton dress. I’ve almost
forgotten how you look in one--‘cause two months represents years to me.<br />
<br />Your Wednesday night letter tells me “If there isn’t (a letter)--perhaps
I’d better stop writing so much and often.” You of course know what your letters
mean to me, and altho’ I live from one day to another for them, I realize such a
course would only be followed after due reflection and a careful analysis upon
the part of the sweetest most deliberate little girl in all the world--<br /><br
/>All my love--<br /><br />Lyndon Baines<br /><br />[No envelope with this
letter]<br /><br />[Transcript prepared by LBJ Library staff, January 2013]

Collection</h3><div class="element-text">The Personal Papers of Lyndon and Lady
Bird Johnson are a collection of correspondence between Lyndon and Lady Bird
Johnson that spans 1934 through 1968. During the Johnsons’ years in the White
House, Dorothy Territo, a staff assistant who maintained files of high
historical value, as well as family and genealogical material, had custody of
the collection. In 1969, the files she kept came to Austin as part of President
Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded to the U.S. government in August 1965.This
collection includes the courtship letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia
"Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period between their introduction and their
marriage, September – November 1934.<!-- ?php echo
