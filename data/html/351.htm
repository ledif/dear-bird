<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written on C T stationery]<br />
<br />[October 4, 1934 ?]<br /><br />Thursday Morning<br /><br />Dearest Lyndon
–<br /><br />I’m trying to arrange this so you’ll get this letter Sunday…But
then it will probably arrive before the last two I’ve written so you won’t know
what I’ve said before. It’s quite confusing not getting one’s letters in
sequence, isn’t it? I wonder why your letters get to me in two days and it takes
mine so long?<br /><br />My dearest Lyndon, please don’t write me any more
letters like the last two. They made me feel desolate and everything turns dull
gray.<br /><br />I’ll tell you some of the things that make me unhappy – <br />
<br />2<br /><br />“you may read some of it,” (the clippings) if you have
nothing else to do.” and Of course I shall read them. I shall be very interested
in them. Ever since you first mentioned them I’ve been looking forward to them.
<br /><br />And something else--“Will pass one” (the picture) “on to you if you
want one by that time.” Dear silly, are you being deliberately--oh, I don’t know
what word to use next but its something like cruel and something like cool and
perhaps casual would do.<br /><br />And the worst thing of all was: “Tell me
when you get my letters--and if you read them”…I simply haven’t any comment to
make on that! <br /><br />3<br /><br />No, that wasn’t the worst thing either.
It was that dear little barbed thing you ended with --“its sweet of you to
write.”<br /><br />But I shall not say any things like that in my letters to
you. Because if we both fussed or said sarcastic things or whatever it is at the
same time--something awful might happen to us. And nothing must! I simply will
not let it.<br /><br />I haven’t mailed the pictures to your mother and Alice
and I haven’t read any in my NBC booklets…That’s because I’m in a state of
suspended activity…nothing seems worth doing and I <br /><br />4<br /><br />
haven’t any nerve or ambition since I got your letter Wednesday written Sunday
night. Do you know how much control you have over my happiness--or the lack of
it?<br /><br />But enough of this--you must understand by now how much your
letters mean to me. You won’t let them say any more things to hurt me, will you?
I can’t bear it.<br /><br />(I now make a new beginning!)<br /><br />---A very
charming letter from Gene yesterday--she tells me that she’s begun saving her
money for our trip in January…Did you know how many days there are until January
1? There <br /><br />5 <br /><br />are 88!! Are does it sound shorter to say
less than three months?<br /><br />Today Aunt Venie, who I think came out of the
ark and is colored and is about 102 and is a very good hand with plants, and I
are setting out plants. I have to take up all the plants I want to save out of
the yard as we may get to plowing either next week or the next. Aunt Venie
fetched me five nice dogwoods out of the woods and we’ve set out, besides,
thirty crepe myrtles, two dozen periwinkles and about three dozen assorted
kinds! Venie digs the holes and I <br /><br />6<br /><br />carry the water! <br
/><br />Really, Lyndon, I shall certainly get strong this winter, what with all
the various kinds of labor I’m going in for!<br /><br />I’ve a new
book--Bromfield’s “Early Autumn” and can’t wait to get into it. I’ve joined the
Book-of-the Month Club…Now all I need to join is the Karnack Missionary Society!
<br /><br />Last night Gene’s brothers Karl and Buddy came by and got me and we
went down after Dorris and Hugh and all a-fish-gigging. I lay down across one of
the seats and looked up at the sky most of the time…I’d no idea quite forgotten
how brilliantly beautiful the <br /><br />7<br /><br />sky was on the lake on a
moonless night! And the black, majestic beauty of the cypress trees outlined
against the sky--such things always pull me a little out of the depths no matter
how low I feel.<br /><br />We cau gigged two enormous buffalo and lots of bass
and eight poor fat frogs…I felt sorry for the latter--they are so helpless once
that light shines in their eyes. The fish aren’t so bad--they swim flash by like
greased lightning, and its good sport to try for them.<br /><br />There was one
thing in your last letter I liked the thought of (not the expression of)--that
picture you’re going <br /><br /> 8<br /><br />to send me! That was Tuesday you
had that sitting wasn’t it!--and perhaps you’ll have the proofs and send me one
by next Tuesday.<br /><br />I am going to Dallas Friday and either that
afternoon or the next Monday I shall get you a picture made. I only hope it will
be good.<br /><br />In my next letter I shall tell you what both of us, Dad and
I, think about Welly’s speech…That’s another thing I haven’t done read simply
because I hadn’t the heart to…All the buoyancy has gone, because I haven’t any
nice thoughts to fall back on--and to keep me happy.…About next Wednesday I
shall be looking for a dear, sweet reassuring letter from you. Remember, I love
you, Bird<br /><br />[Transcript prepared by LBJ Library staff, January 2013]

<h3>Abstract</h3><div class="element-text">Lady Bird asks LBJ to not write
letters like the last two she has received, and she describes portions of the
letters that made her unhappy. She does not want anything to hurt their
relationship. She then writes about setting out plants in the yard, going
fishing, and reading. She asks about a picture LBJ had said he planned to send
her and says she plans to have a picture made for him during her upcoming trip
to Dallas.</div><h3>Rights</h3><div class="element-text">Public domain</div><h3>

Collection</h3><div class="element-text">The Personal Papers of Lyndon and Lady
Bird Johnson are a collection of correspondence between Lyndon and Lady Bird
Johnson that spans 1934 through 1968. During the Johnsons’ years in the White
House, Dorothy Territo, a staff assistant who maintained files of high
historical value, as well as family and genealogical material, had custody of
the collection. In 1969, the files she kept came to Austin as part of President
Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded to the U.S. government in August 1965.This
collection includes the courtship letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia
"Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period between their introduction and their
marriage, September – November 1934.<!-- ?php echo
