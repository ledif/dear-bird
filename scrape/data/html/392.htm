<h3>Transcript</h3><div class="element-text">[Written by LBJ at top of letter]
Question - Attention: Who do you love?<br /><br />[Written on Congress of the
United States, House of Representatives, R. M. Kleberg stationery]<br /><br /> 
[September 26, 1934]<br />Wednesday Morning –<br /><br />My dearest;<br /><br />
I feel too good to be a criminal altho’ when I think of my complaints about not
receiving letters I am conscious of having been too exacting and expectant. Your
letters mean so much that when I don’t get one in the morning mail my stock
immediately starts going down. Yesterday I wrote complaining--only to have the
mail boy bring me a letter an hour after mine had been posted. He said it wasn’t
mailed at the right time to be delivered with the other letter mail. When I
started to school last night I stopped by the Dodge, and to my most pleasant
surprise, I had another letter from you which had been written Friday night. It
was the best letter you have written. It made me so happy to have you tell me
you wanted me. It gave me new life --a real inspiration and a determination to
make you the most happy and contented little woman in all the world.<br /><br />
2<br /><br />If I were only sure--if you could only know how you feel. What a
different slant it would put on the whole matter.<br /><br />Maury (the new
congressman from S. A.) returned from a week-end visit to N. Y. and has been at
the Dodge with me. He is a most interesting personality. The driving type, he is
always going after things--and he gets them.<br /><br />Yesterday we went to the
P. O. dept. early in the morning. We didn’t get back to the office until late in
the afternoon. Had a nice chat with an Bill Bray a young friend of mine who is
Farley’s right hand man. He only married last year and now has a little girl
baby 2 weeks old. Before March ’33 he was employed on the floor of the House but
Farley needed<br /><br />3<br /><br />someone who knew “the hill” and Bill got
the call and shortly afterward got her consent. Now they must be so happy. Bill
promised to send Sam Fore a picture of Farley and gave us assurance that Dan
Quill would be taken care of in S. A. and we were on our way.<br /><br />Down on
the Mexican border across from Piedras Negras there is an old 77 year old
Customs Collector. For years he has served our country faithfully and well. Just
before President Hoover retired from office he blanketed into Civil Service all
of the Mounted Customs men but poor old 77 year old Jim Durst was to old to go
in under the order. The age limit was 70 and that limit got him. Three Customs
Collectors protested. Citizens <br /><br />4<br /><br />all up and down the
border who had known him for years said he was physically fit and mentally
alert. Congressmen wrote letters, sent wires and appeared in person but got
nowhere. Less than a month ago the Secretary of the Treasury refused to ask the
President for an executive order to cover the case. Just after receiving this
word and before I left Texas, Mr. Dick called me to his home and said he wanted
to give me one special commission. “Lyndon,” he said, “if you don’t do anything
from now until January except get old Jim Durst classified your time will be
well spent.” Monday morning I had a pleasant visit with the wife of ex-Governor
McMillen of Tenn. She is now a member of the Civil Service Commission. We talked
of Texas and Texans. She rehearsed her important incidents in her husbands
political career. <br /><br />5<br /><br />I had met her previously and for an
hour we just talked of people, principles and things. She is most intelligent,
considerate, gracious and sympathetic. Before leaving she told me that she would
personally assume the responsibility of selling the other two commissioners on
the Durst classification idea. She sold them and called me late yesterday and
told me that the commission decision had just been handed down in favor of the
old man. Bill White is using a story on it today.<br /><br />Wright Matthews,
Assistant Com. of Int. Revenue, and newly elected President of the Texas Club,
called this morning and discussed the Texas Club program for the year. Hurry and
tell me when you will be here to visit (or to stay??). We must have our biggest
and best celebration when you and Gene are here. Very likely we will have the
dance at the Shoreham and I can’t <br /><br />6<br /><br />think of standing
with you on the terrace--for very long without, coming to Karnack for you.<br />
<br />After our storm in July our Nueces Country farmers lost hundreds of bales
of cotton in the field. They now have hundreds of certificates for which they
have no cotton. Just across the line in other counties our farmers have cotton
and no certificates, hence, before they can gin it they must pay the tax.
Yesterday after conferences with the Chief of the Cotton section, the legal
division and the departments policy committee, a ruling was issued allowing our
farmers to go across the county line, buy seed cotton free of tax, and then
apply their certificate, gin the cotton, and sell it. This will result in an
increased income to these farmers with left over certificates of at least $10
per bale more than they would get if their certificates were place in the pool
(say for instance with the Karnack farmers who have surplus certificates or
surplus cotton). Why am I writing about customs collectors, <br /><br />7<br />
<br />cotton certificates and Internal Revenue Collectors to my love who may not
be interested at all. Perhaps I wouldn’t presume so much if I weren’t so happy
today. Your Friday letter gave me new hope, new interest, new plans and to sum
it all up just thrilled me to death.<br /><br />Hurry and send me the Kodak
pictures. Don’t postpone finding the large picture you looked for but couldn’t
locate the night I was at your home. Then on top of all of that (and that isn’t
much for one who loves you and adores to look at you often) I want you to have
those new pictures made and really rushed to me. Then I’ll have something to
thrill me [illegible word crossed out] in addition to waiting for the postman.
<br /><br />I have all of your letters--one by one in my room. When I can’t
“take it” anymore I reread them and last night I noticed that you had only erred
4 days in not writing. For <br /><br />8<br /><br />a while I thought you had
waited a week to write--then I realized you had only left me less than a week
ago.<br /><br />Honey I can’t write very well. I don’t know how to spell,
punctuate and compose. very well. It is much easier to dictate when you have
been doing that for two years.<br /><br />You wanted a long letter. Here it is.
Now I will brief cases for the next 3 hours. Haven’t had a date since I enrolled
and try to work from 8 until 12. Could work later with you looking on--or
reading with me. Won’t you come and help me to climb?<br /><br />Found a lot of
newspaper pictures and articles when I moved my belongings yesterday. Think I’ll
send them to you so you can see that I can’t take a picture but maybe you would
think the articles flattering and me egotistical so I will wait. (over) (over)
<br /><br /> [9]<br />I couldn’t say goodbye in such a short space but in order
to get all of these pages in one envelope I had to write on the back of this
page.<br /><br />Cong. Jones from Amarillo and Maury just stuck me for the
lunch--so I’m off.<br /><br />Tell me what I hope you want to tell me each time
after you have sealed your letter. Remember?<br /><br />I’m ready now. Are you?
<br /><br />All my love--<br />Lyndon Baines<br /><br />[Envelope postmarked:
Washington, D.C., 9/26/1934, 4 PM]<br /><br />[Transcript prepared by LBJ

Johnson that spans 1934 through 1968. During the Johnsons’ years in the White
House, Dorothy Territo, a staff assistant who maintained files of high
historical value, as well as family and genealogical material, had custody of
the collection. In 1969, the files she kept came to Austin as part of President
Johnson’s papers, which he had deeded to the U.S. government in August 1965.This
collection includes the courtship letters between Lyndon Johnson and Claudia
"Lady Bird" Taylor, from the period between their introduction and their
marriage, September – November 1934.<!-- ?php echo
